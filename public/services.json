    "description": "MSK physiotherapy, short for musculoskeletal physiotherapy, is a specialized branch of physical therapy focused on treating injuries and disorders affecting the muscles, bones, and joints. It aims to alleviate pain, improve mobility, and enhance overall physical function through a combination of manual therapy, exercise, and education. MSK physiotherapists assess conditions such as back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, and post-surgical rehabilitation, tailoring treatments to individual needs.<br />&nbsp;<br />Their approach often includes techniques like joint manipulation, massage, stretching, and strengthening exercises, along with advice on posture and ergonomics to prevent future issues.",
